		Show your pet the love it deserves. At Top Dog Spa and Boutique, we believe every pup deserves royal treatment! Our team of passionate and experienced groomers are dedicated to making your dog look and feel its best. Whether it be a full grooming session, a quick nail trim, or just a relaxing spa day, each service is tailored to meet your furry friend's needs. At our boutique, every dog is Top Dog.

		<h4> History </h4>
		<p> Top Dog Spa and Boutique was founded in May 2022 by Paige Hogan. Founded with a passion for pups and commitment to quality care, we have been in business for over 3 years now. Starting as just a small business, Top Dog offered only trimmings and a few products such as leashes and collars. Thanks to our great team and loving supporters (and furry friends), we have skyrocketed into Massachusetts' most-loved dog groomers! Now, our services involve a full service (bath and brush), a grooming (nail and fur trims), or a styling (collars, bows, bandanas, harnesses)! 
</p>

<h4>Why should you come to us?</h4>
<p>
At Top Dog, we use eco-friendly 100% recyclable products, operating under both fashion and sustainability! Our mission is to sustain a healthy environment and use safe products on your pup (and look and feel like royalty in the end)! Alongside your fur baby is an experienced and dedicated team that will bring a warm welcome and calm environment to each session. <br> Book with Top Dog today! Because pets are family too.

		<h4> BTS: What To Expect At Your Pup's First Visit </h4>
		<p>
		Welcome to our clinic! <br> <br>As you arrive at Top Dog, you will notice the lively environment filled with smiling faces and comfortable pups! Check in at the front desk, where we will take your first and last name, confirm your phone number, your pup's name, as well as your appointment time and service you are booked for. In the case that there is a slight wait for your pup's appointment, you can relax in the waiting room or set your pup free in the open play area with their furry friends! <br> <br>One of our amazing team members will come to welcome your pup in and start their service, whether it be in our clinic, boutique, or both! At this point in time, we restate the estimated length of your pet's appointment, and you may choose whether you will stay in the waiting room with window visibility into the clinic, or to return when we send you an appointment completion text stating your pup is looking like royalty and ready to go! Our team members ensure that each service is completed with love, efficiently. <br> <br>Following the appointment, you may choose to book your pet their next session, or simply just complete payment and checkout. Every appointment is tailored to both you and your pup's needs!
